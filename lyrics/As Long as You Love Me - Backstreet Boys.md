<br>[00:19.320]Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
<br>[00:24.540]I'm leaving my life in your hands
<br>[00:29.750]People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
<br>[00:34.630]Risking it all in a glance
<br>[00:39.150]And how you got me blind is still a mystery
<br>[00:44.140]I can't get you out of my head
<br>[00:49.280]Don't care what is written in your history
<br>[00:53.910]As long as you're here with me
<br>[00:57.630]I don't care who you are
<br>[01:01.310]Where you're from
<br>[01:03.670]What you did
<br>[01:05.890]As long as you love me
<br>[01:08.570]Who you are
<br>[01:11.090]Where you're from
<br>[01:12.860]Don't care what you did
<br>[01:15.610]As long as you love me
<br>[01:18.730]Every little thing that you have said and done
<br>[01:23.530]Feels like it's deep within me
<br>[01:28.420]Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
<br>[01:33.030]It seems like we're meant to be
<br>[01:36.810]I don't care who you are
<br>[01:40.370]Where you're from
<br>[01:42.820]What you did
<br>[01:45.010]As long as you love me
<br>[01:47.730]Who you are
<br>[01:50.150]Where you're from
<br>[01:52.000]Don't care what you did
<br>[01:54.750]As long as you love me
<br>[02:04.580]As long as you love me
<br>[02:14.260]As long as you love me
<br>[02:17.490]I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
<br>[02:21.350]But I guess it shows
<br>[02:24.180]When you look into my eyes
<br>[02:27.860]What you did and where you're coming from
<br>[02:31.150]I don't care
<br>[02:33.760]As long as you love me  baby
<br>[02:45.220]I don't care who you are
<br>[02:48.880]Where you're from
<br>[02:51.320]What you did
<br>[02:53.530]As long as you love me
<br>[02:56.240]Who you are
<br>[02:58.630]Where you're from
<br>[03:00.490]Don't care what you did
<br>[03:03.280]As long as you love me
<br>[03:07.250]Who who you are
<br>[03:09.590]Where you're from
<br>[03:12.100]What you did
<br>[03:14.230]As long as you love me
<br>[03:17.050]Who who you are
<br>[03:19.410]Where you're from where you're from
<br>[03:22.880]As long as you love me
<br>[03:25.600]Who you are
<br>[03:27.770]As long as you love me
<br>[03:30.470]What you did I don't care
<br>[03:33.840]As long as you love me
