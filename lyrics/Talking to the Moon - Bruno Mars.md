<br>[00:07.280]I know you're somewhere out there
<br>[00:09.880]Somewhere far away
<br>[00:12.830]I want you back
<br>[00:16.200]I want you back
<br>[00:20.310]My neighbors think I'm crazy
<br>[00:22.860]But they don't understand
<br>[00:25.910]You're all I have
<br>[00:29.200]You're all I have
<br>[00:34.190]At night when the stars light up my room
<br>[00:40.780]I sit by myself
<br>[00:44.510]Talking to the Moon
<br>[00:51.400]Tryna get to You
<br>[00:58.830]In hopes you're on the other side
<br>[01:02.530]Talking to me too
<br>[01:04.610]Or am I a fool
<br>[01:08.900]who sits alone
<br>[01:10.580]Talking to the moon
<br>[01:19.640]I'm feeling like I'm famous
<br>[01:22.200]The talk of the town
<br>[01:24.960]They say I've gone mad
<br>[01:28.350]Yeah I've gone mad
<br>[01:33.000]But they don't know what I know
<br>[01:35.130]Cause when the sun goes down
<br>[01:38.800]someone's talking back
<br>[01:41.340]Yeah They're talking back
<br>[01:46.450]At night when the stars
<br>[01:48.900]light up my room I sit by myself
<br>[01:56.740]Talking to the Moon
<br>[02:03.320]Tryna get to You
<br>[02:11.160]In hopes you're on the other side
<br>[02:14.820]Talking to me too
<br>[02:17.000]Or am I a fool
<br>[02:20.400]who sits alone
<br>[02:22.920]Talking to the moon
<br>[02:34.570]Do you ever hear me calling?
<br>[02:47.320]Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
<br>[02:55.570]Still trying to get to you
<br>[03:03.770]In hopes you're on the other side
<br>[03:07.440]Talking to me too
<br>[03:09.570]Or am I a fool
<br>[03:12.980]who sits alone
<br>[03:15.420]Talking to the moon
<br>[03:24.410]I know you're somewhere out there
<br>[03:27.829]Somewhere far away
