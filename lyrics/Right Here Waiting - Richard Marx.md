<br>[00:46.000]Oceans apart day after day
<br>[00:51.000]And I slowly go insane
<br>[00:56.000]I hear your voice on the line
<br>[01:02.000]But it doesn't stop the pain
<br>[01:07.000]If I see you next to never
<br>[01:12.000]How can we say forever
<br>[01:16.000]
<br>[01:17.000]Wherever you go
<br>[01:20.000]Whatever you do
<br>[01:22.000]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[01:28.000]Whatever it takes
<br>[01:30.000]Or how my heart breaks
<br>[01:32.000]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[01:43.600]
<br>[01:44.600]I took for granted, all the times
<br>[01:50.900]That I thought would last somehow
<br>[01:55.900]I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
<br>[02:01.900]But I can't get near you now
<br>[02:06.900]Oh, can't you see it baby
<br>[02:11.900]You've got me goin' crazy
<br>[02:15.900]
<br>[02:16.900]Wherever you go
<br>[02:19.900]Whatever you do
<br>[02:21.900]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[02:27.900]Whatever it takes
<br>[02:30.900]Or how my heart breaks
<br>[02:32.900]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[02:38.900]
<br>[02:39.900]I wonder how we can survive
<br>[02:44.900]This romance
<br>[02:49.900]But in the end if I'm with you
<br>[02:54.900]I'll take the chance
<br>[03:22.900]Oh,can't you see it baby
<br>[03:26.900]You've got me going crazy
<br>[03:30.900]
<br>[03:31.900]Wherever you go
<br>[03:33.900]Whatever you do
<br>[03:36.900]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[03:41.900]Whatever it takes
<br>[03:44.900]Or how my heart breaks
<br>[03:47.900]I will be right here waiting for you
<br>[04:01.900]Waiting for you
<br>[04:13.900]
