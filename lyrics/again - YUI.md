<br>[00:08.000]You just made the worst mistake
<br>[00:11.970]And you'll regret it, darling

<br>[00:19.330]You'll only end up wanting
<br>[00:27.710]Was everything hard enough?
<br>[00:35.540]'Cause one day you'll wake up, and you'll say
<br>[00:39.950]I wanna be your lover
<br>[00:44.140]I don't wanna be your friend
<br>[00:47.750]You don't know what you got 'till it's gone my dear

<br>[01:27.620]Ooh, she's screaming in my head
<br>[01:35.480]Ooh, I left her where I slept
<br>[01:43.840]Somewhere I can't escape
<br>[01:47.180]I'm running from myself
<br>[01:51.730]Somewhere in between in love and broken I'm in hell
<br>[01:58.850]Saying, "I wanna be your lover
