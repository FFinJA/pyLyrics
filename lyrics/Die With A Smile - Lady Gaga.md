<br>[00:09.825]I, I just woke up from a dream
<br>[00:16.239]But you and I had to say goodbye
<br>[00:20.787]And I don't know what it all means
<br>[00:25.403]But since I survived, I realized
<br>[00:28.901]
<br>[00:29.568]Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow

<br>[00:54.542]If the party was over
<br>[00:57.475]And our time on Earth was through

<br>[01:15.761]I'd wanna be next to you
<br>[01:16.522]
<br>[01:25.747]Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
<br>[01:34.241]I don't even wanna do this anymore
<br>[01:38.560]'Cause you already know what you mean to me
<br>[01:41.948]And our love's the only one worth fighting for
<br>[01:45.072]
