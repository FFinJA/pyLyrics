<h3>Lyric of Always Remember Us This Way (Lady Gaga) :</h3><p><br>[00:00.650]That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
<br>[00:08.220]You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
<br>[00:15.630]It’s buried in my soul like California gold
<br>[00:22.980]You found the light in me that I couldn’t find
<br>[00:29.210]
<br>[00:30.970]So when I'm all choked up
<br>[00:32.910]But I can't find the words
<br>[00:38.140]Every time we say goodbye
<br>[00:41.240]Baby, it hurts
<br>[00:45.320]When the sun goes down
<br>[00:48.910]And the band won't play
<br>[00:53.160]I'll always remember us this way
<br>[00:58.650]
<br>[01:00.180]Lovers in the night
<br>[01:03.710]Poets trying to write
<br>[01:07.180]We don't know how to rhyme
<br>[01:10.930]But damn we try
<br>[01:14.750]But all I really know
<br>[01:17.960]You're where I wanna go
<br>[01:21.710]The part of me that's you will never die
<br>[01:28.330]
<br>[01:30.170]So when I'm all choked up
<br>[01:31.940]But I can't find the words
<br>[01:36.840]Every time we say goodbye
<br>[01:40.280]Baby, it hurts
<br>[01:44.460]When the sun goes down
<br>[01:48.390]And the band won't play
<br>[01:52.370]I'll always remember us this way
<br>[01:57.250]
<br>[01:57.600]Oh, yeah
<br>[01:59.690]I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
<br>[02:04.350]Ohh oh ooh oh oh oh
<br>[02:11.610]Ooh oh ooh oh oh ooh
<br>[02:16.330]
<br>[02:17.540]When I'm all choked up
<br>[02:19.540]But I can't find the words
<br>[02:25.260]Every time we say goodbye
<br>[02:28.110]Baby, it hurts
<br>[02:31.960]When the sun goes down
<br>[02:35.830]And the band won't play
<br>[02:39.840]I'll always remember us this way, oh, yeah
<br>[02:45.910]When you look at me
<br>[02:50.920]And the whole world fades
<br>[02:54.890]I'll always remember us this way
