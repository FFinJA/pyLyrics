<br>[00:12.150]Who can say where the road goes'
<br>[00:16.730]Where the day flows
<br>[00:19.770]Only time...
<br>[00:23.550]And who can say if your love grows'
<br>[00:28.410]As your heart chose
<br>[00:31.820]Only time...
<br>[01:01.510]Who can say why your heart sighs'
<br>[01:06.040]As your love flies
<br>[01:10.090]Only time...
<br>[01:13.230]And who can say why your heart cries'
<br>[01:18.480]When your love dies
<br>[01:21.490]Only time...
<br>[01:50.920]Who can say when the roads meet'
<br>[01:56.240]That love might be'
<br>[01:59.800]In your heart.
<br>[02:03.200]And who can say when the day sleeps'
<br>[02:08.470]If the night keeps all your heart
<br>[02:15.590]Night keeps all your heart...
<br>[02:45.910]Who can say if your love grows'
<br>[02:51.260]As your heart chose
<br>[02:54.290]Only time...
<br>[02:57.500]And who can say where the road goes'
<br>[03:02.870]Where the day flows
<br>[03:05.840]Only time...
<br>[03:09.570]Who knows
<br>[03:11.640]Only time...
<br>[03:15.230]Who knows
<br>[03:17.830]Only time...
