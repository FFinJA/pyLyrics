<br>[00:09.15]I want you to know
<br>[00:17.01]I'm a mirrorball
<br>[00:21.07]I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
<br>[00:29.76]I'll get you out on the floor
<br>[00:34.06]Shimmering beautiful
<br>[00:38.53]And when I break it's in a million pieces
<br>[00:44.93]Hush
<br>[00:45.98]When no one is around my dear
<br>[00:51.47]You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
<br>[00:55.73]Spinning in my highest heels love
<br>[00:59.28]Shining just for you
<br>[01:02.41]Hush
<br>[01:03.51]I know they said the end is near
<br>[01:08.84]But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
<br>[01:13.21]Spinning in my highest heels love
<br>[01:16.71]Shining just for you
<br>[01:19.90]I want you to know
<br>[01:26.79]I'm a mirrorball
<br>[01:30.81]I can change everything about me to fit in
<br>[01:36.23]You are not like the regulars
<br>[01:43.64]The masquerade revelers
<br>[01:48.06]Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
<br>[01:54.72]Hush
<br>[01:55.75]When no one is around my dear
<br>[02:01.15]You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
<br>[02:05.55]Spinning in my highest heels love
<br>[02:09.09]Shining just for you
<br>[02:12.11]Hush
<br>[02:13.13]I know they said the end is near
<br>[02:18.59]But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
<br>[02:22.96]Spinning in my highest heels love
<br>[02:26.47]Shining just for you
<br>[02:29.62]And they called off the circus
<br>[02:31.88]Burned the disco down
<br>[02:33.79]When they sent home the horses
<br>[02:35.98]And the rodeo clowns
<br>[02:38.07]I'm still on that tightrope
<br>[02:40.37]I'm still trying everything
<br>[02:43.70]to get you laughing at me
<br>[02:46.97]I'm still a believer
<br>[02:49.09]But I don't know why
<br>[02:51.21]I've never been a natural
<br>[02:53.49]All I do is try try try
<br>[02:55.80]I'm still on that trapeze
<br>[02:57.89]I'm still trying everything
<br>[03:01.18]To keep you looking at me
<br>[03:06.62]Because I'm a mirrorball
<br>[03:11.46]I'm a mirrorball
<br>[03:15.31]I'll show you every version of yourself
<br>[03:20.65]Tonight
