<br>[00:01.000] 作曲 : David Foster/Linda Thompson/Walter Afanasieff
<br>[00:07.530]I'm scared, so afraid to show I care
<br>[00:18.280]Will he think me weak if I tremble when I speak
<br>[00:31.560]Ooh, what if there's another one he's thinking of
<br>[00:44.290]Maybe he's in love, I'd feel like a fool
<br>[00:50.820]Life can be so cruel, I don't know what to do
<br>[01:02.940]I've been there with my heart out in my hand
<br>[01:13.380]But what you must understand
<br>[01:17.000]You can't let the chance to love him pass you by
<br>[01:28.320]Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
<br>[01:37.310]Reach out to him
<br>[01:40.700]And whisper tender words so soft and sweet
<br>[01:47.180]I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
<br>[01:51.000]Love will be the gift you give yourself
<br>[02:00.630]Touch him with the gentleness you feel inside（I feel it）
<br>[02:11.170]Your love can't be denied, the truth will set you free
<br>[02:17.510]You'll have what's meant to be, all in time you'll see
<br>[02:28.200]
<br>[02:33.630]Of that much I can be sure（Hold him close to you）
<br>[02:39.770]I don't think I could endure if I let him walk away
<br>[02:46.440]When I have so much to say
<br>[02:54.990]Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
<br>[03:04.180]Reach out to him
<br>[03:07.120]And whisper tender words so soft and sweet
<br>[03:13.920]I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
<br>[03:17.720]Love will be the gift you give yourself
<br>[03:24.570]Love is light that surely glows
<br>[03:27.950]In the hearts of those who know
<br>[03:31.220]It's a steady flame that grows
<br>[03:36.850]Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
<br>[03:42.410]Tonight love will assume its place
<br>[03:45.800]This memory time cannot erase
<br>[03:48.890]Your faith will lead love where it has to go
<br>[03:56.750]Tell him, tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
<br>[04:05.280]Reach out to him
<br>[04:08.660]And whisper, whisper words so soft and sweet
<br>[04:15.440]I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
<br>[04:18.980]Love will be the gift you give yourself
<br>[04:27.470]Ooh, never let him go
