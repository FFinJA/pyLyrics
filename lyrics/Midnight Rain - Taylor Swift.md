<h3>Lyric of Midnight Rain (Taylor Swift):</h3><p>[Intro]<br>Rain<br>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain<br>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name<br>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same<br>All of me changed like midnight<br>[Verse 1]<br>My town was a wasteland<br>Full of cages, full of fences<br>Pageant queens and big pretenders<br>But for some, it was paradise<br>My boy was a montage<br>A slow-motion, love potion<br>Jumping off things in the ocean<br>I broke his heart 'cause he was nice<br>He was sunshine, I was midnight rain<br>[Chorus]<br>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain<br>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name<br>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same<br>All of me changed like midnight<br>[Verse 2]<br>It came like a postcard<br>Picture perfect shiny family<br>Holiday peppermint candy<br>But for him, it's every day<br>So I peered through a window<br>A deep portal, time travel<br>All the love we unravel<br>And the life I gave away<br>'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain</p><p>[Chorus]<br>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain<br>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name<br>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same<br>All of me changed like midnight rain<br>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain<br>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name<br>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same<br>All of me changed like midnight<br>[Outro]<br>I guess sometimes we all get<br>Just what we wanted, just what we wanted<br>And he never thinks of me<br>Except for when I'm on TV<br>I guess sometimes we all get<br>Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted<br>And I never think of him<br>Except on midnights like this<br>(Midnights like this, midnights like this)</p>
