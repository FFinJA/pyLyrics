<br>[00:01.870]The whispers in the morning
<br>[00:07.040]Of lovers sleeping tight
<br>[00:14.110]Are rolling like thunder now
<br>[00:20.720]As I look in your eyes
<br>[00:27.970]I hold on to your body
<br>[00:34.370]And feel each move you make
<br>[00:41.540]Your voice is warm and tender
<br>[00:45.570]A love that I could not forsake
<br>[00:54.980]'Coz I am your lady
<br>[01:01.840]And you are my man
<br>[01:08.700]Whenever you reach for me
<br>[01:15.600]I'll do all that I can
<br>[01:22.430]Even though there may be times
<br>[01:29.360]It seems I'm far away
<br>[01:36.500]Never wonder where I am
<br>[01:40.800]'Coz I am always by your side
<br>[01:49.780]'Coz I am your lady
<br>[01:56.660]And you are my man
<br>[02:03.540]Whenever you reach for me
<br>[02:10.390]I'll do all that I can
<br>[02:17.260]We're heading for something
<br>[02:23.660]Somewhere I've never been
<br>[02:30.970]Sometimes I am frightened
<br>[02:33.970]But I'm ready to learn
<br>[02:37.790]Of the power of love
<br>[02:48.300]The sound of your heart beating
<br>[02:54.990]Made it clear suddenly
<br>[03:01.940]The feeling that I can't go on
<br>[03:08.720]Is light years away
<br>[03:15.600]'Coz I am your lady
<br>[03:22.360]And you are my man
<br>[03:29.250]Whenever you reach for me
<br>[03:35.470]I gonna do all that I can
<br>[03:42.940]We're heading for something
<br>[03:49.820]Somewhere I've never been
<br>[03:56.660]Sometimes I am frightened
<br>[03:59.720]But I'm ready to learn
<br>[04:03.510]Of the power of love
<br>[04:21.390]The power of love
<br>[04:41.450]The power of love
